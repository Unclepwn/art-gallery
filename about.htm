          <p>I’m a full-time freelance graphic designer, illustrator and
 artist that likes to decorate T-shirts, snowboards, and posters with 
whatever crazy designs pop into my head. (But don’t let the bright 
colours fool you- I also do a lot of corporate work!)</p>
<p>I’m always taking on new projects, so if you have something coming up
 and think we’d work well together, shoot me an email:

  <h4>Experience</h4>
  <dl>
    
    <dt><i class="strong">Graphic Designer (contract)</i> at <a href="http://whistlerbeer.com/">Whistler Brewing Co.</a></dt>
    <dd><i class="small">Jan 2015 – Mar 2015 <i class="separator"></i> Vancouver, Canada</i>
    <aside><p>I was hired on as the contract graphic designer, and was 
quickly immersed in creating internal sell sheets, promo material, 
posters, signage and social media graphics for all of the Whistler 
Brewing drinks. There were loose brand standards in place already, so it
 was my job to build on those and give the brand some punchy, eye 
catching new material that would appeal to the targeted demographic.</p>
</aside></dd>
    
    <dt><i class="strong">Graphic Designer (contract)</i> at <a href="http://www.bowenislandbeer.com/">Bowen Island Brewing</a></dt>
    <dd><i class="small">Jan 2015 – Mar 2015 <i class="separator"></i> Vancouver, Canada</i>
    <aside><p>I was hired on at Bowen Island to work on the same 
elements as I was at Whistler- print collateral, in-store signage, and 
social media headers and posts. The brand had the elements in place 
already, but, like the Whistler brand, it needed an update. I worked 
with the existing elements to revamp the designs, using bolder styles 
and more relevant layouts.</p>
</aside></dd>
    
    <dt><i class="strong">Graphic Designer (contract)</i> at <a href="https://rockinriverfest.com/">Rockin' River Music Fest 2015</a></dt>
    <dd><i class="small">Oct 2014 – Ongoing <i class="separator"></i> Mission, BC</i>
    <aside><p>I occasionally take on contract work from design firms 
that need an extra hand on a project; this was one of those. I was hired
 to take control of all design elements, which included posters, ads, 
highway road signs, illustration, character design, campsite badges, and
 t-shirts. There was no set look to the project, and I had complete 
creative control… so, being an illustrator, I decided to go in that 
direction. I decided on a cute, illustrative theme that would make the 
music festival easily identifiable, and that would look good across the 
board- on ads, merchandise, and decorative posters.</p>
</aside></dd>
    
    <dt><i class="strong">Artist (contract)</i> at <a href="http://www.gilsonboards.com/">Gilson Snowboards</a></dt>
    <dd><i class="small">Oct 2014 – Dec 2014 <i class="separator"></i> Pennsbury, PA</i>
    <aside><p>The guys at Gilson Boards contacted me about putting some 
art on their snowboard decks- the owner is a bird lover, and my bird art
 sparked his interest. I was given the green light to design 3 different
 decks, with one being put into production for this past season and two 
held over until next winter.</p>
</aside></dd>
    
    <dt><i class="strong">Graphic Designer and Web Designer (contract)</i> at <a href="http://ratherbedogwalking.com/">Rather Be Dog Walking </a></dt>
    <dd><i class="small">Mar 2014 – Jun 2014 <i class="separator"></i> Toronto, Canada</i>
    <aside><p>I was hired alongside my fiancé (a web developer, and co-owner of our web business, <a href="http://www.twobudgies.com/">www.twobudgies.com</a>)
 to design and implement a new look for their website and logo, with the
 intent to bring it up to date in both image and usability.</p>

    <dt><i class="strong">Graphic Designer (contract)</i> at <a href="http://www.phyleticlifestyle.com/">Phyletic Lifestyle Clothing</a></dt>
    <dd><i class="small">Jan 2014 – March 2014 <i class="separator"></i> Edmonton, Canada</i>
    <aside><p>I worked with the guys at Phyletic Lifestyle Clothing for a
 few months, where I was in charge of branding the company (it was new 
at the time), and then creating art for their first line of active wear.
 I then went further, and developed the colour palette for their Summer 
2014 line of t-shirts, both for men and women.</p>
</aside></dd>
    
    <dt><i class="strong">Graphic Designer and Concept Artist</i> at <a href="http://www.trenchmarketing.com/">Trench Marketing Projects Ltd.</a></dt>
    <dd><i class="small">May 2012 – May 2013 <i class="separator"></i> Stratford, Canada</i>
    <aside><p>One half of the company sells large inflatable advertising
 products and characters, and the other half specializes in small scale 
advertising and business-related signage/print. As the designer for both
 companies, I was responsible for small jobs like logos and branding on 
already-designed products and apparel, as well as the impressive 50' 
tall custom-designed inflatables, for which I was the concept artist and
 renderer.</p>
</aside></dd>
    
    <dt><i class="strong">Graphic Designer and Web Designer</i> at <a href="http://weprevailmusic.com/">Prevail Music</a></dt>
    <dd><i class="small">Apr 2011 – May 2012 <i class="separator"></i> London, Canada</i>
    <aside><p>I did all of the graphic and web design for the bands we 
signed, as well as for the company itself. When I was designing for 
artists, it was important to brand them so they’d appeal to their target
 audience. When I was doing design for the company, a more corporate, 
refined look was needed.</p>
</aside></dd>
    
    <dt><i class="strong">Digital Colourist (contract)</i> at <a href="http://www.conceptual.ca/">Conceptual Pathways</a></dt>
    <dd><i class="small">Jan 2011 – April 2011 <i class="separator"></i> Stratford, Canada</i>
    <aside><p>I was hired on contract by Conceptual Pathways as the 
colourist for a series of character illustrations for a piece of 
software called Powernoodle. There were approximately thirty historical 
characters in use for the game-themed online-meeting software, and I was
 to take the existing illustrations (which were no more than line art at
 the time) and add colour digitally. Using my Wacom Intuos 4 Tablet, I 
vectorized the pencil sketches, created the line art, and chose the 
colours for each one based on historical documents, the software’s 
existing colour schemes, and possible applications (and therefor 
possible contrasts), and then added base colours, highlights and 
shading.</p>

    <dt><i class="strong">Graphic Designer</i> at Wilson Trophy</dt>
    <dd><i class="small">Feb 2010 – Oct 2010 <i class="separator"></i> Mississauga, Canada</i>
    <aside><p>Wilson Trophy was a national supplier of 
provincial/state-level sporting event trophies and awards. I initially 
came on to design type-focused plaques, but ended up rotated between 
design and production.</p>
</aside></dd>
    
    <dt><i class="strong">Junior Graphic Designer</i> at <a href="http://blackcatadvertising.com/">Black Cat Advertising</a></dt>
    <dd><i class="small">Jan 2007 – Oct 2008 <i class="separator"></i> Scarborough, ON</i>
    <aside><p>I was one of many designers in this small advertising 
firm. My jobs usually entailed bits and pieces of bigger jobs, such as 
photo editing, layouts, type editing and copy writing, but very often 
I’d be pulled into a campaign, and would be assisting lead designers 
from start to finish.</p>
</aside></dd>
    
    <dt><i class="strong">Graphic Designer</i> at Designs Beyond Words</dt>
    <dd><i class="small">March 2006 – Jan 2007 <i class="separator"></i> Hamilton, Canada</i>
    <aside><p>I was the in-house graphic designer at this two person 
sign shop, and spent my days working on business cards, flyers, signage,
 car decalling, and direct mail pieces. I was also somewhat of a 
secretary, as I was the first person clients dealt in the business.</p>
